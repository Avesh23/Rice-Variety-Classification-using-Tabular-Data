ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest Machine Learning project!

I built a Tabular Classification Model using PyTorch to classify rice types based on their physical attributes. The project workflow included:

ðŸ”¹ Data Preprocessing â€“ Cleaning, normalization, and splitting into train, validation, and test sets (70/15/15).
ðŸ”¹ Custom Dataset & Dataloader â€“ For efficient batch loading and GPU support.
ðŸ”¹ Neural Network Model â€“ A feedforward network with hidden layers and sigmoid activation.
ðŸ”¹ Training & Validation â€“ Achieved high accuracy through proper optimization (Adam + BCELoss).
ðŸ”¹ Testing & Evaluation â€“ Final Test Accuracy: 98.61% ðŸŽ¯
ðŸ”¹ Inference Module â€“ Built an interactive prediction system where users can input rice grain parameters and instantly get classification results.

ðŸ“Š The model achieved excellent generalization, as shown by training vs validation accuracy and loss curves.

This project helped me strengthen my knowledge of:
âœ… Deep Learning with PyTorch
âœ… Handling tabular datasets for classification
âœ… Model evaluation and inference building

I look forward to applying these skills to solve real-world problems using AI & ML! ðŸš€
